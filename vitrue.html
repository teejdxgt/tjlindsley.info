						<h2>Vitrue</h2>
						<p>Vitrue was an industry pioneer for creating enterprise software for marketers to create, track, and monitor engaging content across social networks (Facebook, Twitter, and Google+).<br /><br />
						In 2011 the company raised $17 million in series C funding, more than doubled itâ€™s annual revenue, experienced nearly 300% growth in personnel, and was ranked by Forbes magazine as one of the top 50 most promising companies in America.<br /><br />
						In 2012 Vitrue was acquired by Oracle for $300 million.</p>

								<h3>Custom Applications</h3>
								<p>Vitrue initially grew quickly building custom applications for large brands like Apple, P&G, Turner, and AT&T.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<p>During this phase I regularly met with our customers to understand their needs and then worked with our engineering team to ensure that we delivered timely and well executed solutions.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<p>Some of the applications built during this time period were productized and became the initial version of the Vitrue SRM (Social Relationship Management) platform.</p>

								<h3>Productized Software</h3>
								<p>In 2010 Vitrue began selling licenses to our Publishing and Content Management products and growing exponentially because of the demand for the new applications.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<p>I continued to be responsible for the success of our custom applications, while additionally managing the development, growth, and execution of our Publishing app.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<p>At the end of the 2010 Vitrue raised $17 million to expand it's two products into a full software platform for enterprise social marketing.</p>

								<h3>SRM Platform</h3>
								<p>Vitrue released it's full SRM platform during the summer of 2011. In addition to publishing and content management capabilities, the new platform added moderation, user administration, and analytics to the Vitrue offering.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<p>The new platform leveraged a service oriented architecture using technologies like Ruby on Rails, Mongo DB, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Erlang, Redis, and Backbone.js. I managed the buildout and integration of multiple services and client facing applications.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<p>Vitrue's product development team grew from 10 to 35 people during the same time period. I was responsible for managing relationships with recruiters & universities, pre-screening candidates, and coordinating business needs with applicant skills.</p>

								<h3>Oracle Acquisition</h3>
								<p>The SRM platform combined with a robust offering of client services grew Vitrue's already impressive client roster to include brands like Intel, Microsoft, Pernod Ricard, Clear Channel, and Lowes. As the company and industry continued to significantly grow, Vitrue became an attractive acquisition target for multiple enterprise software companies.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<p>During this period of maturation and growth I continued to help grow our engineering team and led the product development process for our analytics and account administration tools by working closely with product owners and software engineers on release planning, product delivery, platform integration, and the continuous improvement of the products.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<p>In the summer of 2012 Oracle acquired Vitrue as the first piece in it's marketing cloud platform strategy. Shortly after Vitrue was acquired Oracle also announced their purchases of Involver and Collective Intellect, which would also be components for the Oracle Social Marketing Platform.</p>
