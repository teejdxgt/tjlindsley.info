						<h2>Oracle</h2>
						<p>The Oracle Social Marketing Cloud provides brands and agencies with the tools to execute social marketing strategies.<br /><br />
						It is a component of the Oracle Social Marketing Cloud, which through high profile and strategic acquisitions (Eloqua, Responsys, BlueKai, etc.) has become an industry leading marketing cloud solution.</p>

								<h3>Unifying Acquisitions</h3>
								<p>Oracle acquired Vitrue, Involver, and Collective Intellect during the summer of 2012 with the intent of combining the 3 platforms into a single social marketing platform that would function as a single solution for all social Listening, Engagement, Monitoring, and Messaging needs.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<p>During the spring of 2013 I managed the execution of the first phase of the unification process which gave the platform a unified feel by creating a common UI across the many applications making up each platform.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<p>This first phase was extremely important for bringing the three acquisitions together as a single team and platform and also laid the groundwork for more difficult but powerful integrations at lower application layers and was also received very well by the market.</p>

								<h3>Integrating Platforms</h3>
								<p>The second and third phases of the unification initiative were to  centralize all user administration and SSO into a single application and then to centralize all business object management in the same application.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<p>It was decided that all users and objects would be administered from the former Vitrue administration application and so it was my responsibility to manage the execution of the final 2 phases as well. Despite many technical, organizational, and political challenges, the platforms were fully consolidated in early 2014.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u">
								<p>The three phase project (UI integration, User/Account integration, and Data Objects integration) required participation from teams across 4 geographical locations (Atlanta, Austin, San Francisco, and Boulder) and resulted in the Oracle Social Marketing Cloud's defining competitive feature; being a one stop shop for all major Social Marketing functionality.</p>
